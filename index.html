                    <p>Tractiv is a startup company my team and I created during our bachelor. We made an interactive assistant for handball coaches that utilizes AI and Computer Vision to support them. The system utilised the yolov4 framework and that Nvidia Jetson Platform.</p>

                    <p>As we saw potential in the idea we decided to pursue it further and participate in the UT Challenge, which is an annual startup contest hosted at the University of Twente. Here we worked with the Dutch Police, Bronkhorst and Novel T to further improve our idea. In the end we managed to reach the grand final beating out over 80 other competitors.</p>

                    <h3>Active Learning (Thesis project)</h3>
                    <p>For my bachelor thesis in Creative Technology I worked on an active learning algorithm in the point cloud environment. This project was part of the Ambient Intelligence Research Group at Saxion University.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://essay.utwente.nl/94542/1/Hentschel_BA_EEMCS.pdf" target="_blank">Publication</a></p>
                    <p>During this project I learned a lot about Machine Learning and the concepts that surround it. The goal of this project was to create a computer vision algorithm that detects railway infrastructure in 3D point cloud scans. This is done to help workers with maintenance. My part in this project was to use active learning to decrease the amount of labelled data necessary. I was able to achieve a precision of upwards of 75% with only 5% labelled data.</p>

                    <h3>Computer vision + path finding algorithm</h3>
                    <p>In this project I simulated a very basic grocery store environment. The goal was to automatically detect certain products through computer vision, and then combine this with a path finding algorithm to find the shortest path through the simulated supermarket.</p>

                    <h3>Pill Detection</h3>
                    <p>For this project we set out to design a healthcare related solution. We found the problem of elderly people with impaired cognitive function and vision having a hard time finding the right medicine and/or getting confused between them. We therefore came up with a device where the pills can be inserted in any random order and are automatically sorted into various storage compartments. The device then dispenses the pills at the right amount and time set by a medical professional. Additionally the device recognises if the pill has been taken, if the pill is not taken for some time it will notify medical help.</p>

                    <div class="photography-text">
                        <p>Beyond my technical projects, I'm passionate about photography. I capture moments, emotions, and perspectives through my lens, exploring the intersection of art and technology.</p>
                        <p>My photographic style focuses on finding beauty in both natural landscapes and urban environments. I'm particularly drawn to unique lighting conditions, architectural details, and capturing the essence of a place or moment.</p>
                        <h3>My Approach</h3>
                        <p>I believe photography is about more than just technical skill—it's about developing an eye for composition, light, and storytelling. Each image represents a unique perspective and a moment in time that can never be exactly replicated.</p>
