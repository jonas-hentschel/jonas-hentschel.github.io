### Tractiv

Tractiv is a startup company my team and I created during our bachelor. We made an interactive assistant for handball coaches that utilizes AI and Computer Vision to support them. The system utilised the yolov4 framework and that Nvidia Jetson Platform. Below you can find two Videos explaining the Idea. Both Videos were entirely made by us.

As we saw potential in the idea we decided to pursue it further and participate in the UT Challenge, which is an annual startup contest hosted at the University of Twente. Here we worked with the Dutch Police, Bronkhorst and Novel T to further improve our idea. In the end we managed to reach the grand final beating out over 80 other competitors. <br />

### Active Learning (Thesis project)

For my bachelor thesis in Creative Technology I worked on an active learning algorithm in the point cloud environment. This project was part of the Ambient Intelligence Research Group at Saxion University.

During this project I learned a lot about Machine Learning and the concepts that surround it. The goal of this project was to create a computer vision algorithm that detects railway infrastructure in 3D point cloud scans. This is done to help workers with maintenance. My part in this project was to use active learning to decrease the amount of labelled data necessary. I was able to achieve a precision of upwards of 75% with only 5% labelled data.
